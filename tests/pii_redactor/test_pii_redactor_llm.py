"""Real-model tests for pii-redactor.

Marked llm_judge so they stay out of the default run: they load a local model
and cost real time. Run them with:

    pytest -m llm_judge tests/pii_redactor -v -s

These are the two integration cases from the bats suite. They assert the PII is
gone and a placeholder appeared, deliberately without pinning the exact wording
— the model chooses the placeholder, and asserting on its phrasing would make
the test fail on a model change rather than on a regression.
