"""Unit tests for pii-redactor's pure helpers.

These have no bats equivalent — under bash the output templating could only be
exercised by running the whole CLI and looking at which file appeared. Calling
default_output() directly makes the path edge cases explicit and fast, which is
where the real subtlety lives: a dotted directory must not be mistaken for an
extension, and a dotfile must not lose its name.

    Measured 2026-11-05: CI failed 55 pii_redactor tests with
    `FileNotFoundError: /home/runner/bin/pii-redactor`. `SCRIPT` was
    `Path.home()/"bin"/"pii-redactor"`, which exists only after
    `chezmoi apply` — so the suite tested a deployed machine and
    errored everywhere else.

    The tests need the script's source, which is always in the repo.
    This pins the property that matters: with no deployed copy, the
    resolver returns something that exists and can actually run. An
    earlier version of this test asserted a path shape (`home` or
    `bin` in the parts), which broke as soon as the resolver staged
    an executable copy into a temp directory — the shape was never
    the property, the runnability is.
