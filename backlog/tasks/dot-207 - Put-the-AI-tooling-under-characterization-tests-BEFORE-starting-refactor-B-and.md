## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Put the AI tooling under characterization tests BEFORE starting refactor B, and
  use them as the parity bridge. Audit the existing behaviour, add tests that pin
  it, then let the reimplementation run against the same tests. Parity becomes
  proven rather than assumed, and the rewrite stops being gated on a human
  re-reading every line. B5 needs this most — the eval harness is the largest
  surface being moved.
