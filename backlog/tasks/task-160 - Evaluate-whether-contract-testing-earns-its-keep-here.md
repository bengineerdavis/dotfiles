## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Evaluate whether contract testing earns its keep here. The candidate seams are
  real: `bin/policy`'s exit codes (0/1/2/3) consumed by several callers, the
  `ollama-evals` case schema shared by 25 YAML files, and the model-manifest
  shape that `sync`/`prune`/`status` all read. Today each consumer re-asserts the
  contract in its own tests, which is the duplication the item above is about.
  Decide: one contract per seam with consumer tests deriving from it, or leave it.
